4. Thou shalt remain consistent. Thy code will follow a consistent format. Thy interface elements will remain consistent with the rest.
5. Thy procedures shalt not be named using different conventions (camel case, lower case with underscores). Thy variables will follow a similar format. 
6. Thou shalt not cause lag. Thy code will not cause more stress than necessary. Looping will not be undertaken more than required. Del will be used only where it cannot be avoided and where qdel will not suffice. Procedures will remain efficient in their purpose.
